The introduction of master's level work in these subject areas should be effected immediately. Because of its traditional commitment to the arts and sciences and the presence of strong teaching departments, the only factor which should initially limit the introduction of master's programs is the availability of appropriate space. Programs in the humanities and social sciences at the doctoral level should be developed as early as possible.
